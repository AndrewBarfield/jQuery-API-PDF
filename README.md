jQuery API PDF
==============

Generates a PDF from the jQuery Raw XML API Dump. The PDF features a table
of contents and index. When the PDF is successfully created it is cached
server-side for some customizable time. Accessing the script during that
period results in an HTTP 302 redirection to the PDF.
